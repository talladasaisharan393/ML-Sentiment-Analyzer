# ML-Sentiment-Analyzer

Developed an ML Sentiment Analyzer to predict emotions from text data. The objective was to accurately classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., using a dataset of labeled text. The project involved data cleaning, label encoding, and transforming text data into numerical features using TF-IDF. A Random Forest model was trained on the processed data, achieving a high accuracy rate. Tools and techniques used include Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and TF-IDF vectorization. The model can predict the emotion of any given text input, demonstrating practical applications in sentiment analysis and natural language processing.
